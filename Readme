A collection of React Apps for Experimentation and Practice

node_modules is common for projects. This is to save ourselves from creating multiple node_modules folders.
From inside the react application we link node_mudules folder to '../node_modules'

% pwd
/Users/neeraj/Projects/Practice/Reactjs/react-apps/react-firebase-database-app
% ls -l node_modules 
lrwxr-xr-x  1 neeraj  staff  15 Aug 21 11:24 node_modules -> ../node_modules

We will create new Project using cp command

# R - recursive copy, 
# H - do not follow and copy symbolic links

cp -RH react-firebase-database-app react-new-app
